# jASN1
jASN1 is an LGPL licensed Java ASN.1 BER encoding/decoding library.

# Fork
I'm not the author of jASN1 and I've never use it.

The goal of this fork is to have a nice way to check the diff between 2 jASN1 versions (see https://github.com/juherr/jASN1/tree/mainstream).
Previously, the second goal was to use binarynotes as 3rd party dependency instead of copy/paste the code into jASN1. But since 1.5, binarynotes was integrated and modify too deeply.

If you have any question regarding to jASN1, please contact the authors here: https://www.openmuc.org/contact/
